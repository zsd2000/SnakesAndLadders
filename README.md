# Snakes and Ladders (Java Console Game)

A console-based implementation of the classic **Snakes and Ladders** board game, built entirely in **Java**.  

This project demonstrates **object-oriented design**, **modular architecture**, and **clean coding practices**.  

Future updates will include **JUnit testing** and optional **AI/automation components** for quality assurance exploration.

---

## Overview
Players take turns rolling a die and moving across the board.  

Landing on a ladder moves the player up, while landing on a snake sends them down.  

The first player to reach the final square wins.

This project focuses on **backend logic**, not UI â€” making it an ideal demonstration of structured problem solving and Java fundamentals.
